# Documentation

Backlooper.app is a looper that allows you to decide to loop a few bars after you played them.
It is not necessary to hit "record" before playing a loop.
Audio is always being recorded.
The last few bars will be looped if you select a track at approximately the first beat of the next bar.

## Setup
Backlooper.app consists of 2 parts: the frontend which runs in the browser and the backend which runs on your local machine.
The [frontend](https://backlooper.app) will try to connect to the backend on your local machine.
The backend is written in Python and can be started using

```
python -m backlooper
```

Please refer to the [installation instructions](https://backlooper.app/docs/install) for further information.

## Hardware
An example setup with an audio interface and MIDI controller is as follows.

![Example setup with an audio interface and MIDI controller](../images/setup_border_width_10.drawio.png "Example setup with an audio interface and MIDI controller")

The input can be an instrument, mic or both.
The MIDI controller is optional, but makes looping much more comfortable.

## Looping
It is not necessary to hit "record" before playing a loop.
Audio is always being recorded.
The last few bars will be looped if you select a track between the 4th beat of the preceding bar and the 3rd beat of the next bar.
The idea is that you first play what you want to loop, and afterwards select a track.
This will automatically start playback.

The bottom part of the interface contains settings that affect the looping, such as BPM and the number of bars to record.
Several buttons can be MIDI-mapped, as indicated by a MIDI MAP button.
Click on the MIDI MAP button and then press the desired MIDI button or slider to complete the mapping.
