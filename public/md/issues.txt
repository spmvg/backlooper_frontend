# Resolving common issues

* If the **latency** is intolerable, make sure you select an audio device with ASIO drivers.
  For example, the audio device might show up as: "_Focusrite USB ASIO, ASIO (2 in, 2 out)_".
* If the **audio device is unavailable**, there might be another application claiming the audio device.
* If **calibration fails**, inspect the [latency calibration diagram](https://www.backlooper.app/docs/calibration). Make sure that the input receives enough signal from the output.
* If the **backend cannot be reached**, check if the backend is running, no firewall is blocking the connection and make sure Javascript is allowed in the browser.

If none of the points above resolve your issue, consider raising an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/spmvg/backlooper_backend/issues).
