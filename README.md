# Backlooper.app

[Backlooper.app](https://backlooper.app) is a looper that allows you to decide to loop a few bars after you played them.
It is not necessary to hit "record" before playing a loop.
Audio is always being recorded.
The last few bars will be looped if you select a track at approximately the first beat of the next bar.

For user documentation, please see [here](https://backlooper.app/docs/general).
