# Calibration
There is latency between the input and the output of the audio interface.
Music is live, so this latency must be corrected for.
Backlooper.app corrects for latency automatically if you use a device with ASIO drivers.
In most cases, manual calibration is not necessary.

If you configure a device without ASIO drivers, you must perform manual calibration to get the correct latency. In this case, follow the instructions below.

## Calibration setup
To calibrate, connect the output to the input directly. If you are using speakers, it may be sufficient to increase the volume slightly. The setup is as follows:

Make sure that direct monitoring is OFF to prevent feedback. Then, start the calibration using the CALIBRATE button. This process takes approximately 9 seconds. Once latency has been measured, it is automatically saved.

## Latency calibration diagram

If you need to investigate issues with calibration, use the "SHOW CALIBRATION DIAGRAM" button to inspect the latency calibration diagram. The following diagram shows a successful calibration with a latency of 377 ms:

If latency calibration fails, ensure that your audio interface is receiving enough input signal.
