# Calibration
There is latency between the input and the output of the audio interface.
Music is live, so this latency must be corrected for.

Determining the round trip latency depends on many factors.
Backlooper.app takes an empirical approach to latency correction.

## Latency measurement setup
Latency must be measured before a session.
It is not easy to measure the input latency or the output latency individually, but the combination of both can be measured.

To calibrate, connect the output to the input directly.
The setup looks as follows:

Make sure that direct monitoring is OFF to prevent feedback.
Then, start the calibration using the CALIBRATE button.
This process takes approximately 9 seconds.
Once latency has been measured, the latency is automatically saved.

## Latency calibration diagram
To investigate issues with calibration, the latency calibration diagram can be inspected using the "SHOW CALIBRATION DIAGRAM" button.
The following diagram shows a successful calibration with a latency of 377 ms.

If latency calibration fails, make sure that the input receives enough signal on the audio interface.
