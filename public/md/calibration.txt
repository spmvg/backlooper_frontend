# Calibration
There is latency between the input and the output of the audio interface.
Music is live, so this latency must be corrected for.

Determining the round trip latency depends on many factors.
Backlooper.app takes an empirical approach to latency correction.

## Latency measurement setup
Latency must be measured before a session using the following setup.
It is not easy to measure the input latency or the output latency, but the combination of both can be measured.
The output is directly sent back into the input and the latency is measured.

Make sure that direct monitoring is OFF to prevent feedback.
Then, start the calibration using the CALIBRATE button.
This process takes approximately 9 seconds.
Once latency has been measured, the latency is automatically saved.

## Latency calibration diagram
To investigate issues with calibration, the latency calibration diagram can be inspected using the SHOW DIAGRAM button.
The following diagram shows a successful calibration with a latency of 377 ms.

If latency calibration fails, make sure that the input receives enough signal on the audio interface.
