# Installation
Backlooper.app consists of 2 parts: this frontend which runs in the browser and the backend which runs on your local machine.
The [frontend](https://backlooper.app) will try to connect to the backend on your local machine.
The backend is written in Python and can be started using

```
python -m backlooper
```

## Installing the backend
The backend can be installed like any Python package:

```
python -m pip install backlooper
```

Installing Python itself can be done [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
