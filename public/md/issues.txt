# Resolving common issues

* To **change the audio device**, adjust the default audio device of the operating system and restart the backend. The default audio device will be taken.
  * On Windows, the audio device is configured in "Settings" → "System" → "Sound".
* If the **audio device is unavailable**, there might be another application claiming the audio device.
* If **calibration fails**, inspect the [latency calibration diagram](https://www.backlooper.app/docs/calibration). Make sure that the input receives enough signal.

If none of the points above resolve your issue, consider raising an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/spmvg/backlooper_backend/issues).
